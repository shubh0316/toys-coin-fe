                The beginning of the transition period into foster care can be one of the most difficult times for a child. Many times, the child is placed in foster care during the middle of the night, with nothing but the clothes they are wearing. Toys Coin Foundation is a new charity dedicated to offering much needed comfort in the form of toys and non-toy essential items during this difficult time.Â All donations made by our community are shipped directly by donors to our vetted foster care agency partners.
